# Prediction-of-Fare-of-Airline-Tickets
The projects aims to build such a machine learning model that can do prediction of departure time , arrival time,route,destination details with temperature ,weather information of different destinations .  Addition to more features and building machine learning model,  understanding more about the dataset. The project aims from data analysis to data wrangling, data preprocessing, also to deal with feature selection and many other machine learning and natural language processing techniques as well. Using machine learning algorithms , NLP and  trying to understand what exactly can be  the accuracy of different algorithms.
